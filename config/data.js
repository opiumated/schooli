        description: "Millions of people use computers every day but few understand how computers do what they do. Even if you don’t plan to be a professional programmer, you’ll benefit from understanding the very basics of digital machines and from learning to write basic programs in a managed but powerful environment. By understanding how a computer works and learning to think logically, you’ll write better programs and be able to troubleshoot technical problems more easily. This Professional Certificate will start you at the absolute beginning teaching you about the fundamental binary language of modern computers. You’ll learn about the Turing Machine—a model for the digital computer. You’ll also learn the basics of analytic logic and how learning and applying basic principles of logic can help you both work with and work on technical solutions. You’ll work in a managed environment and learn to code your very first program in Python – a powerful but simple programming language used by app developers and data scientists. You’ll be able to monitor your progress through regular assessments and hands-on projects will give you the foundational experiences you need to understand modern digital machines. The exercises and assessments will help you continually evaluate your learning and help you focus on the areas where you need to improve your skills. The courses in this certificate program will provide you with a solid foundation for working with computers in any field.",
